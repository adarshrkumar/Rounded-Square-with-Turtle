# Rounded-Square-with-Turtle

A Python Turtle graphics program that draws a square with rounded corners.

## How It Works

Uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a square where each corner is replaced with a smooth 90-degree arc, creating a rounded rectangle effect.

## Features

- Fullscreen canvas display
- Adjustable scale factor
- Smooth corner rounding using small forward movements with gradual turns
- Animated drawing process

## Running

```bash
python main.py
```

## Customization

Edit `main.py` to adjust:
- `scale` - Size of the square (default: 200)
- `t.speed()` - Drawing speed

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle (included in Python standard library)

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Turtle graphics
- Poetry for dependency management
